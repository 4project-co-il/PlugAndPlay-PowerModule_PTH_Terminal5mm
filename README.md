# PlugAndPlay: Power Module with 5mm PTH Terminal Block
This is the repository with the files for Power Module for the PlugAndPlay boards.

That module is equiped with 5mm PTH Terminal Block and is rated for up to 18A of current, but the PCB can't handle that current.
The PCB and connections of the power modules on PlugAndPlay devices are designed to pass up to 10A, although wasn't tested.
